# Goldpinger

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/bloomberg/goldpinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/bloomberg/goldpinger)

__Goldpinger__ makes calls between its instances to monitor your networking.
It runs as a [`DaemonSet`](#example-yaml) on `Kubernetes` and produces `Prometheus` metrics that can be [scraped](#prometheus), [visualised](#grafana) and [alerted](#alert-manager) on.

Oh, and it gives you the graph below for your cluster. Check out the [video explainer](https://youtu.be/DSFxRz_0TU4).

## Rationale

We built __Goldpinger__ to troubleshoot, visualise and alert on our networking layer while adopting `Kubernetes` at Bloomberg. It has since become the go-to tool to see connectivity and slowness issues.

It's small (~16MB), simple and you'll wonder why you hadn't had it before.

If you'd like to know more, you can watch [our presentation at Kubecon 2018 Seattle](https://youtu.be/DSFxRz_0TU4).

## Quick start

Getting from sources:

```sh
go get github.com/bloomberg/goldpinger/cmd/goldpinger
goldpinger --help
```

Getting from [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/bloomberg/goldpinger):

```sh
# get from docker hub
docker pull bloomberg/goldpinger:v3.0.0
```

## Building

The repo comes with two ways of building a `docker` image: compiling locally, and compiling using a multi-stage `Dockerfile` image. :warning: Depending on your `docker` setup, you might need to prepend the commands below with `sudo`.

### Compiling using a multi-stage Dockerfile

You will need `docker` version 17.05+ installed to support multi-stage builds.

```sh
# step 1: launch the build
make build-multistage

# step 2: push the image somewhere
namespace="docker.io/myhandle/" make tag
namespace="docker.io/myhandle/" make push
```

This was contributed via [@michiel](https://github.com/michiel) - kudos !

### Compiling locally

In order to build `Goldpinger`, you are going to need `go` version 1.13+ and `docker`.

Building from source code consists of compiling the binary and building a [Docker image](./build/Dockerfile-simple):

```sh
# step 0: check out the code
git clone https://github.com/bloomberg/goldpinger.git
cd goldpinger

# step 1: compile the binary for the desired architecture
make bin/goldpinger
# at this stage you should be able to run the binary
./bin/goldpinger --help

# step 2: build the docker image containing the binary
make build

# step 3: push the image somewhere
namespace="docker.io/myhandle/" make tag
namespace="docker.io/myhandle/" make push
```

## Installation

`Goldpinger` works by asking `Kubernetes` for pods with particular labels (`app=goldpinger`). While you can deploy `Goldpinger` in a variety of ways, it works very nicely as a `DaemonSet` out of the box.

### Authentication with Kubernetes API

`Goldpinger` supports using a `kubeconfig` (specify with `--kubeconfig-path`) or service accounts.

### Example YAML

Here's an example of what you can do (using the in-cluster authentication to `Kubernetes` apiserver).

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: goldpinger-serviceaccount
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: goldpinger
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: goldpinger

        runAsUser: 1000
        fsGroup: 2000
      containers:
        - name: goldpinger
          env:
            - name: HOST
              value: "0.0.0.0"
            - name: PORT
              value: "8080"
            # injecting real hostname will make for easier to understand graphs/metrics
            - name: HOSTNAME
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: spec.nodeName
            # podIP is used to select a randomized subset of nodes to ping.
            - name: POD_IP
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: status.podIP
          image: "docker.io/bloomberg/goldpinger:v3.0.0"

              memory: 40Mi
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
              name: http
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /healthz
              port: 8080

            periodSeconds: 5
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /healthz
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 20
            periodSeconds: 5
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: goldpinger
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: goldpinger
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      nodePort: 30080
      name: http
  selector:
    app: goldpinger
```

Note, that you will also need to add an RBAC rule to allow `Goldpinger` to list other pods. If you're just playing around, you can consider a view-all default rule:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: default
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: view
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: goldpinger-serviceaccount
    namespace: default
```

You can also see [an example of using `kubeconfig` in the `./extras`](./extras/example-with-kubeconfig.yaml).

### Using with IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack

If your pods having IPv4 and IPv6 addresses assigned and you want to test communication over IPv6, you can specify the `USE_IPV6` environment variable which will use the IPv6 address on the pod and host.

![ipv6](./extras/screenshot-ipv6.png)

### Note on DNS

Note, that on top of resolving the other pods, all instances can also try to resolve arbitrary DNS. This allows you to test your DNS setup.

From `--help`:

```sh
--host-to-resolve=      A host to attempt dns resolve on (space delimited) [$HOSTS_TO_RESOLVE]
```

So in order to test two domains, we could add an extra env var to the example above:

```yaml
            - name: HOSTS_TO_RESOLVE
              value: "www.bloomberg.com one.two.three"
```

and `goldpinger` should show something like this:

![screenshot-DNS-resolution](./extras/dns-screenshot.png)

### Note on Hosts

In addition to pinging IPs, you can use `HOSTS_TO_PING` (similar to `HOSTS_TO_RESOLVE`) that will ping arbitrary host names in addition to IPs

```yaml
            - name: HOSTS_TO_PING
              value: "www.bloomberg.com one.two.three"
```

## Usage

### UI

Once you have it running, you can hit any of the nodes (port 30080 in the example above) and see the UI.

![](./extras/screenshot-big.png)

You can click on various nodes to gray out the clutter and see more information.

### API

The API exposed is via a well-defined [`Swagger` spec](./swagger.yml).

The spec is used to generate both the server and the client of `Goldpinger`. If you make changes, you can re-generate them using [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) via [`make swagger`](./Makefile)

### Prometheus

Once running, `Goldpinger` exposes `Prometheus` metrics at `/metrics`. All the metrics are prefixed with `goldpinger_` for easy identification.

You can see the metrics by doing a `curl http://$POD_ID:80/metrics`.

These are probably the droids you are looking for:

```sh
goldpinger_peers_response_time_s_*
goldpinger_peers_response_time_s_*
goldpinger_nodes_health_total
goldpinger_stats_total
goldpinger_errors_total
```

### Grafana

You can find an example of a `Grafana` dashboard that shows what's going on in your cluster in [extras](./extras/goldpinger-dashboard.json). This should get you started, and once you're on the roll, why not :heart: contribute some kickass dashboards for others to use ?

### Alert Manager

Once you've gotten your metrics into `Prometheus`, you have all you need to set useful alerts.

To get you started, here's a rule that will trigger an alert if there are any nodes reported as unhealthy by any instance of `Goldpinger`.

```yaml
alert: goldpinger_nodes_unhealthy
expr: sum(goldpinger_nodes_health_total{status="unhealthy"})
  BY (instance, goldpinger_instance) > 0
for: 5m
annotations:
  description: |
    Goldpinger instance {{ $labels.goldpinger_instance }} has been reporting unhealthy nodes for at least 5 minutes.
  summary: Instance {{ $labels.instance }} down
```

Similarly, why not :heart: contribute some amazing alerts for others to use ?

### Chaos Engineering

Goldpinger also makes for a pretty good monitoring tool in when practicing Chaos Engineering. Check out [PowerfulSeal](https://github.com/bloomberg/powerfulseal), if you'd like to do some Chaos Engineering for Kubernetes.

## Contributions

We :heart: contributions.

Have you had a good experience with `Goldpinger` ? Why not share some love and contribute code, dashboards and alerts ?

If you're thinking of making some code changes, please be aware that most of the code is auto-generated from the `Swagger` spec. The spec is used to generate both the server and the client of `Goldpinger`. If you make changes, you can re-generate them using [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) via [`make swagger`](./Makefile).
